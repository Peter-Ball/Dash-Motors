# Dash-Motors
A basic Dash app for my plot.ly interview.

This app takes 3 parameters from the provided dataset: 
  1.Miles per Gallon
  2.Horsepower
  3.Weight

It constructs bar graphs for each, and maps them together in a 3d scatter plot.
You can flip between the graphs with a dropdown menu.
In the scatter plot you are able to change the colouring of the markers using radio buttons to highlight each of the three parameters. This is done to make the results of the graph more clear.
NOTE: I was not able to figure out how to label the axes of the 3D scatter plot. The axes are:
x: Miles/Gallon
y: Horsepower
z: Weight (in tons)
